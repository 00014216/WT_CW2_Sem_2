Welcome to the Event Planner Web App!
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our simple yet effective Event Planner Web Application! This little tool helps you organize your events hassle-free.

Getting Started
Getting started with our app is as easy as pie! Just follow these simple steps:

Download or Clone the Repository: First things first, make sure you've got the repository downloaded or cloned onto your computer.

Open the HTML File: Once you've got the repository set up, open the index.html file in your favorite web browser.

Start Planning Events: You're all set! Fill in the event details in the form fields provided and hit that "Submit" button. Need to make changes? No problem! You can edit or delete existing event information too.

What Can You Do?
Add Events: Have an event coming up? Just fill in the event name, place, date/time, and your email, and hit "Submit" to add it to the list.
Edit Events: Made a mistake or need to update some details? Simply click on the "Edit" button to make changes to existing event information.
Delete Events: No longer need an event listed? Just click on "Delete" to remove it from the list.

Understanding the Files
index.html: This file is where the magic happens! It contains the structure of our web page, including the form to input event details and the table to display them.
script.js: Here's where we handle all the behind-the-scenes work with JavaScript. It manages form submission, validation, adding, editing, and deleting event information.

Dependencies
We use Bootstrap for styling our application, making it look snazzy without too much effort on our part.
